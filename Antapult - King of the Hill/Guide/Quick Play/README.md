# Quick play guide!

Welcome to the *Antapult: King of the Hill* quick play guide!!!

As a player, the goal of the game is to gather resources to build up your colonies and troops in an effort to get the most victory points as fast as possible.

With that in mind, let's get you set up to play the game

## Set up

### Keeping track of pieces

#### Player Pieces
Before placing more pieces on the table, make sure all of your pieces to play the game are at hand!

As a reminder, each player at least needs:

- 10 d6 as a method of tracking the number of ants in each unit
- 10 numbered tokens to keep track of the units you have out in the field
- 10 reference cards to keep stock of what each unit may be holding
- 3 colony tokens to keep track of where you can spawn your troops and return resources
- 2 antapult meeples
- 2 battle rams
- 3 shield tokens

Also whilst not necessary, it's nice to have this info on hand or in card form!

- 1 troop reference card for ant types and general factoids about their abilities
- 1 crafting reference card that lists what troops can be bought
- 1 crafting reference card that lists what items can be made
- 1 building reference card that lists what building can be made

#### Pieces for the board

Now that that has been settled, let's make sure that all pieces for the board are still present!

- 37 tile pieces
- 10 of each type of resource
  - Leaf
  - Stick
  - Rock
  - Food
- 36 victory point tokens

Finally, we get to talk about...
