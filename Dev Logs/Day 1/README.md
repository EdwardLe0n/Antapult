# Day 1 [11/10/2024]

So I'm definitely starting fairly late, but late is better than never supposedly.

Anyways, hello there viewer! The name's Edward, and if you stumbled upon this then you're probably one of the unlucky souks that I talk to about the thumby

consistently

No, I will not apologize

Anyways, now that's out of the way, why are we here?

Well...

## I'm looking to make a game for the Thumby!

What's the Thumby you may ask? Well, it's a silly little console that anyone can use!

However, it has some very obvious limitations. 

For one...

### There aren't too many buttons to work with

I was well aware of this from the get-go, and if anything, I view the limited inputs that players are given as a fun challenge to try out for development.

If anything, that's going to be half the fun moving forward.

There are other various issues I have in mind, but I'll eave that talk for another day.

### Looking forward

#### Current Tasks

- Updating the GitHub with...
  - Issues
  - Milestones
  - Past code

#### Future Tasks

- Initial design work
 - Sketches
 - Basic wireframe
- Hella code (and prioritizing)
  - Input manager
  - Displaying open-world stuff
  - and much more!!!
 
TLDR : Looking forward to seeing where this goes!
