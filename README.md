# Antapult : A week of work here and there

## Welcome to Antapult!

Antapult is a running project that started with a random guy (me) liking Pikmin too much!

# Antapult: The Thumby Portion

## So what happened?

Python. Python happened.

TLDR, I was too busy, but that storys been told

However, I'm still looking to work on the thumby in terms of this project, however I won't set a confirmation on that yet.

# Antapult: King of the Hill

## What's 'Antapult: King of the Hill'?

'Antapult: King of the Hill' is a physical board game with heavy resource management and troop allocation elements, inspired by games like 'Catan' and 'The Battle of Polytopia'

As of the time writing this, it is not complete.

## Overall conclusion/ personal thoughts

#### So what came of the project?

Honestly not a lot. This is primarily due to the fact that I attempted to make a game for a thumby, but due to time constraints with other conflicting events in my life, it ended u getting a shift to physical game in tha tail of development.

#### Do I wish the circumstances were different?

Absolutely.

But that's a story for another day!

#### What would you have done differently?

Not participate in a jam given my current schedule...

In a more productive mindset, I wish I did more testing with the thumby api, as there isn't really a built in camera controller, so I would've need to go about that from the ground up
