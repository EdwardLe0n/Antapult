# Antapult : A week of work here and there

## Welcome to Antapult!

Antapult is a running project that started with a random guy (me) liking Pikmin too much!

# Antapult: The Thumby Portion

## So what happened?

Python. Python happened.

Finish later.

# Antapult: King of the Hill

## What's 'Antapult: King of the Hill'?

'Antapult: King of the Hill' is a physical board game with heavy resource management and troop allocation elements, inspired by games like 'Catan' and 'The Battle of Polytopia'

Finish later.

## Overall conclusion/ personal thoughts

#### So what came of the project?

Honestly not a lot. This is primarily due to the fact that I attempted to make a game for a thumby, but due to time constraints with other conflicting events in my life, it ended u getting a shift to physical game in tha tail of development.

Finish later.

#### Do I wish the circumstances were different?

Absolutely.

But that's a story for another day!

Finish later.

#### What would you have done differently?

Not participate in a jam given my current schedule...

In a more productive mindset, I wish I did more testing with the thumby api, as there isn't really a built in camera controller, so I would've need to go about that from the ground up

Finish later.
